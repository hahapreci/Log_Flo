This project recognizes that women who have Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have very unsual/few/long periods. Unlike regular period trackers that do not consider
irregular periods, this flo tracker speculates when your next cycle begins but allows for users to document when exactly their period began. The calaculations are based on a 28 day cycle. This project makes use of Microsoft SQL Server, C# ASPX web forms and  web development structures.

The main features of this implementation are: 
- ASP.Net C# Web forms that act as a presentation layer which offers a user-friendly experience, making period tracking intuitive and accessible.
- SSMS SQL to create a database table to store and retrieve user details
- ASP.NET Gridview with SQLDatasource to display, update and edit data field.
